Optimizing Stock Trading Strategy with K-Means Clustering
This repository focuses on developing and optimizing a stock trading strategy using unsupervised machine learning, specifically K-means clustering. By clustering historical stock price data, this project aims to identify patterns in price movements that can inform better decision-making for buying and selling stocks. The use of K-means clustering allows for the grouping of similar price behaviors, helping traders capitalize on recurring trends or anomalies in the stock market.

Objectives:
Pattern Discovery: Use K-means clustering to detect underlying structures in historical stock prices, identifying clusters that represent distinct stock behavior.
Strategy Optimization: Enhance stock trading strategies by leveraging clustered data, improving the timing of buy/sell signals for maximum profitability.
Performance Evaluation: Backtest trading strategies based on the clusters to evaluate performance, risk, and return under various market conditions.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize raw stock market data, ensuring quality inputs for the clustering model.
K-Means Clustering Implementation: Apply K-means to divide stocks into meaningful clusters, helping uncover trends that may not be immediately visible.
Cluster Visualization: Generate visualizations of the clustered data, including stock prices and cluster centers, to provide insights into market behavior.
Trading Strategy Development: Create trading rules based on identified clusters (e.g., enter/exit trades when certain clusters appear), and compare their performance against standard strategies.
Backtesting: Simulate the trading strategy on historical data to measure profitability, risk, and other performance metrics.
Parameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of clusters, initialization methods) to improve clustering accuracy and trading performance.
Scalable and Modular Codebase: Designed for flexibility, allowing easy integration with other machine learning models or data sources for further experimentation and enhancement.
Technology Stack:
Python for data processing, K-means clustering, and strategy implementation.
Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn for implementing K-means clustering.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Backtrader for backtesting and evaluating trading strategies.
Future Enhancements:
Integration with real-time stock data for live strategy evaluation.
Exploration of advanced clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN, for better segmentation of market data.
Development of reinforcement learning models to further refine the stock trading strategy.
This project is ideal for those interested in the intersection of machine learning and financial markets, offering a hands-on approach to building data-driven trading strategies.
